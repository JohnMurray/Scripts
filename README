Git Commit Prepare (git_commit_prepare.rb)
   Purpose: prepare a project for submission to a git repository. The
            script creates .gitifnore files for all empty directories
            (in case your project depend on those directories, like a
            cache directory)
   Usage: call the script like 'ruby git_commit_prepare.rb path/to/project/folder'
          Note: do not use an absolute path

SVN Production Prepare
   Purpose: prepare a directory structure that has previously been
            used with SVN for a production environment. Essentially
            all this script does is crawl your directory and remove
            all .svn folders
   Usage: call teh script like 'ruby svn_production_prepare.rb path/to/project/folder'
          Note: do not use an absolute path
