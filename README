Git Commit Prepare (git_commit_prepare.rb)
   Purpose: prepare a project for submission to a git repository. The
            script creates .gitifnore files for all empty directories
            (in case your project depend on those directories, like a
            cache directory)
   Usage: call the script like 'ruby git_commit_prepare.rb path/to/project/folder'
          Note: do not use an absolute path


SVN Production Prepare(svn_production_prepare.rb)
   Purpose: prepare a directory structure that has previously been
            used with SVN for a production environment. Essentially
            all this script does is crawl your directory and remove
            all .svn folders
   Usage: call teh script like 'ruby svn_production_prepare.rb path/to/project/folder'
          Note: do not use an absolute path


Absolute Directory (abs_dir.rb)
    Purpose: find an absolute direcotry path given a relative path
             (from where the program is currentl executing).
    Usage: include into your ruby file and call abs_dir('path')
           where path is a relative path to either a file or a
           directory
    Note: if you are using it to get the path to a file, the path
          may not be pretty (ex: /var/www/app/code/controller/../../media/js.js)
